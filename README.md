This project is to share codes for Ph.D. interview. 

The attachements are my programming examples. The first one is a Baidu Map POI fetcher (Java), which retrieves POIs from Baidu API and 
stores them in a MySQL database. I have annotated this program. The second one is my assignment (C#) for graduate course Advanced GIS 
at PKU, which implements interpolation, contour line generation, convex hull generation, TIN generation etc. I also attache documents 
for the software though they are in Chinese. Due to massive codes for this program, I did not revise the annotations.

I meant to implement the algorithm in the paper titled "Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks" (attachement 3). 
However, time presses. If needed, I will provide the implementation for this algorithm.
